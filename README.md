# Slightly-Modified-Debate-Matcher
Slightly modified Arsalaan's debate matcher to make it work well for an online setting.
Please refer to Arsalaan's orginal code to see what changes were made. 
(Spoiler, not much. But, you know what, it was a learning experience for me, Yang,
and now I can say that I actually know how to use APIs and Google Cloud Services, oh, and my own Mac, too.)
